## Multi-Threaded Web Server

- [Passenger HQ](https://www.phusionpassenger.com) - [:octocat:](https://github.com/phusion/passenger), [:gem:](https://rubygems.org/gems/passenger) - also known as "Raptor"; C++ core, zero-copy architecture, watchdog system and 
       hybrid evented, multi-threaded and multi-process design by Phusion Inc.

- [Puma HQ])(http://puma.io) - [:octocat:](https://github.com/puma/puma), [:gem:](https://rubygems.org/gems/puma) - a simple, fast, threaded, and highly concurrent HTTP 1.1 server for rack apps by Evan Phoenix et al


## Simple Single-Threaded Web Server

- [Unicorn HQ](http://unicorn.bogomips.org) - [(git)](http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git), [:gem:](https://rubygems.org/gems/unicorn) - a HTTP server for rack apps and Unix/Unix-like kernels; workers all run within their own isolated address space and only serve one client at a time for maximum robustness by Eric Wong et al

- [WEBrick :octocat:](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/lib/webrick.rb) - included in the standard library (stdlib); a HTTP server toolkit - use as an HTTPS server, a proxy server, and a virtual-host server


## Async I/O, Multi-Plexed (Single Event Thread) Web Server 

- [Thin HQ](http://code.macournoyer.com/thin) - [:octocat:](https://github.com/macournoyer/thin), [:gem:](https://rubygems.org/gems/thin) - a simple and fast web server; powered by event machine by Marc-Andr√© Cournoyer et al

- [Goliath HQ](http://goliath.io) - [:octocat:](https://github.com/postrank-labs/goliath), [:gem:](https://rubygems.org/gems/goliath) - non-blocking (async) web server framework; powered by event machine; uses fibers to untangle the complicated callback-based code into "plain old" linear-execution

- [Reel HQ :octocat:](https://github.com/celluloid/reel) - [:gem:](https://rubygems.org/gems/reel) -  a fast, non-blocking "evented" web server built on Celluloid::IOby Tony Arcieri


## More / Misc Web Servers

[Event Machine HQ](http://rubyeventmachine.com) - [:octocat:](https://github.com/eventmachine/eventmachine), [:gem:](https://rubygems.org/gems/eventmachine) -  a fast, single-threaded engine for arbitrary network communications; wraps all interactions with IP sockets, allowing programs  to focus on coding the network protocols; works for both network servers and clientsby Francis Cianfrocca, Aman Gupta et al
